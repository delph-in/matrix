# The Grammar Matrix

The Grammar Matrix is a [DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net/) project
for creating ("customizing") [HPSG] grammars for deep linguistic
analysis. It has been used to teach university courses in grammar
engineering as well as to jumpstart development on larger grammars,
such as [Zhong] (Chinese languages) and [INDRA] (Indonesian).

> **NOTE:** This repository is currently being ported from Subversion
> *and* converted from Python 2 to 3, so there may be some portions
> that do not work as intended.
