HOW TO USE THIS FILE:

  When you add something, put in the date and identify yourself.
  Prefix each item with feat: (a feature request), bug: (a bug), or
    misc: (anything else).
  When you fix something, mark it DONE:


[10/4/2006 sfd]

DONE: Improve TDL pretty-printing
DONE: Make TDLfile handle DOTTED.NAME.FORMAT correctly
bug:  Fix layout oddities when the main-page dropdown buttons are clicked
      (by using images?)
bug:  TDLfile treats ... as an identifier -- I don't think that will merge
      correctly
misc: validate.py and customize.py are getting pretty big -- should each
      module be split into a separate, er, module?
DONE: Do something nicer with the validation error messages.  The desired
      goal is marking every form field that needs fixing.  Somehow.
      [ Added the red-asterisk feature. ]
DONE: Add pretty-printing for the choices file (the random ones are just
      jumbled together)
DONE: Still need validation for all modules [done but ongoing]
bug:  Clean up the ????? stuff in the customization page, either by
      rewriting it or inserting them

[10/6/2006 sfd]

DONE: Remove old sessions after some amount of time (days?) [ 24 hours ]
DONE: Add a Reset button to all forms

[10/9/2006 sfd]

DONE: Add a link/button to download the choices file
bug:  Move the negative adverb to the sentential negation page?
DONE: Create reasonable friendly names for everything
DONE: Variable name harmonization

[10/11/2006 sfd]

bug:  Don't get confused by duplicated #corefs when merging TDL.  Also
      don't repeat them if they're identical (type names, too).
DONE: In a TDL conj, sort to keep the type names first
DONE: When printing the right side of a TDL typedef, indent any type names
      to the level of the :=, but indent the final [TFS] two spaces

[10/11/2006 sfd]

DONE: Something is wrong with omnisyndeton -- neither lexically- nor
      morphologically-marked strategies seem to be working.

[10/15/2006 erb]

feat: When adding seed strings, get their actual length and put it in
      `i-length' so we can manipulate by length in tsdb++
bug:  randgram.py is currently forcing non-finite forms to be the same
      as the finite forms.  We should eventually update the seed strings
      to allow for distinct forms and test this.

[1/21/2007 erb]

DONE: Edit Version.lsp to create a value of *grammar-version* which
      reflects both the date on customize.py (or perhaps matrix.tdl)
      and the language name supplied by the user.
bug:  Consider doing something to check whether matrix-core/matrix.tdl
      matrix-core/roots.tdl and other contentful files are synched with
      main matrix repository.  Er, and clean up which files are actually
      needed in matrix-core (roots.tdl, for example, isn't used).  Consider
      removing files that are completely produced by customize.py from
      matrix/ itself.

[6/27/2007 sfd]

bug:  basic-script shouldn't end up in customized grammars

[6/30/2008 sfd]

bug:  As hinted at above, the handling of script files is suspicious.
      There's a Zulu-specific file checked into matrix/lkb that gets
      copied up to WEB/matrix-core/lkb by tolive, then ignored.
      There's also a basic_script in matrix/modules that gets copied
      to WEB/matrix-core, and that's what the script file in generated
      grammars is based on.
feat: The creation of a matrix-core directory should be split into
      another script (perhaps 'tocore').  In fact, tolive should be
      reworked so it does this:
      1) Make a temp local copy of what's going up to the web
         directory (including the creation of a matrix-core directory)
      2) Do a single big copy (local or remote) of those files
      3) Blow away the temp local copy
