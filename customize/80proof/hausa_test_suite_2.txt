#Newman divideds Hausa verbs into eight different grades.  The grades have a distinct phonolgical specification, defined in terms of tone pattern and termination (final vowel or consant). Some of the grades have associated grammtical/semantic characterization others do not.  Within each grade the form of the verbvaries depending on the syntactic context. There are four recognized forms.  The A-Form is used if the verb occurs without a following object (intransitive or object was dropped).  The B-Form occurs when the verb is immediately followed by a personal pronoun direct object.  The C-Form is the analytical underlying form and occurs when the verb is followed by a a direct object that is not a personal pronoun.  The D-Form is used before a indirect object.  Verbs can undergo changes in tone and vowel patterns to move from one grade to another.  The differences between Forms is also determined by vowel changes (including length changes) and tone changes.  Since internal word changes are not supported by the LKB I have abstracted away from these forms by simply labeling them as AForm, BForm, etc.  

#Some morphemes do not have an underlying tone.  Their tonal realization, instead, depends on the tone of the syllable that precedes them.  Usually, they take the opposite.  Toneless morphemes are indicated by a an underscore "_" following the morpheme.  Newman posits two sets of object pronouns.  Weak pronouns and strong pronouns.  They differ in the environments in which they appear and in the fact that the strong object pronouns always have high tone while the weak object pronouns are toneless and clitics. I have shown the weak object pronouns as attaching to the verb.

#Example 36 is a grammatical example of a habitual verb. "The habitual consists of a light syllable wsp (which gets H tone by polarity) plus the TAM marker "-kàn."  The habitual occurs in general and Rel environments.  In principle it is allowed in the negative, although, many speakers switch to the negative-continuous.  There is free variation in the length of the initial bà(a) of the negative...The habitual deotnes customary action, without explicit reference to time.  It often expresses an ongoing habit, where it is best translated by the English present tense, 'I do so and so.'  It can, however, also refer to past time as indicated by English 'used to'" (a:59). If an appropriate time adverb were used the following example could be glossed as "He used to go to the bank."

#Example 38 is a grammatical example of a subjunctive verb.  The subjunctive's TAM is phonologically zero.  It appears in a variety of environments including after modal adverbials, subordinating conjunction, negative commands, and a "softer" imperative.  Newman makes a distinction between the subjunctive TAM which is phonologically zero and the netural form which lacks a TAM (a:591).

#Example 40 The standard word order is SVO; however it is possible to have other word orders with focus and topicalization.  Focus is formed by fronting the focused constituent before the S and optionally adding a stabilizer (nee/cee/nee)(m/f/pl).  The stabilizer can be deleted and Newman says that "it is not clear in the least what accounts for the presence of absence of STAB in focus construction nor what is its actual frequency of occurrence."  Since the STAB can be deleted I do not think it is possible to say that OSV is ungrammatical based solely on the surface form.  An important restriction on focus is that the TAM of the S that follows be a Rel form.

#Example 53 Noun phrases can be coordinated with the conjuction 'dà.' It can be polysndeton or N-syndeton.  dà Bello dà Musa (Bello and Musa) is acceptable and shii dà Musa (he and Musa) is acceptable as well.

#Example 59 There are for 4 ways to mark yes/no questions: question morpheme, intonation, sentence-final interrogative tag, sentence-initial interrogative word.The question morpheme consists of making the final tone low and lengthening the vowel.  If the final tone is already low there is no surface change in tone.  If the final sound is a consonant or long vowel, the vowel length addition has no affect on surface structure. I am representing this morpheme as 'Q'.  It is added to the end of the sentence (a:497).
