Error: Problems in type file

The problem with 3SING-LEX-RULE was several morphs with the name value
"3sing", which despite belonging to different slots, ended up getting
defined as the same type.

    verb-slot1_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot2_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot3_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot4_morph1_name=3sing
    verb-slot11_morph1_name=3sing

The problem with aorist was (apparently) that it had
no supertype declared, which led to the system not defining
it in the tdl at all:

section=tense-aspect
tense-definition=build
  tense1_name=present
    tense1_supertype1_name=tense
  tense2_name=aorist
  tense3_name=past
    tense3_supertype1_name=tense
  aspect1_name=indefinite
    aspect1_supertype1_name=aspect
  aspect2_name=habitual
    aspect2_supertype1_name=aspect

Added:

    tense2_supertype1_name=tense

Now the grmmar loads, but I get these warnings:

These warnings are because the irules.tdl file contains duplicate
entries for each of the above rules.  The entries are exact
duplicates, so there is no harm done wrt to parsing, but it is
definitely a bug somewhere.

Not parsing, because the indefinite suffix isn't defined.
But the definite prefix is.  So maybe we can do an indefinite
suffix, even if we can't get the meaning quite right.

The boy sees the girl regularly.

While chasing down this one, I noticed that this rule doesn't
have any featural content:  

  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb2
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb3
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la

It should probably constrain the aspect, at least!

The problem with #15 seems to be that the aspect marker won't
take the obj marker as an input, and the subj marker won't take
the aspect marker as an input.  Try this:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_opt=on
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot6_input3_type=verb-slot3
    verb-slot6_input4_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la

Output now parses twice.

Trying with aspect information:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_opt=on
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot6_input3_type=verb-slot3
    verb-slot6_input4_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_name=aspect
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_value=habitual

That rescued ex #15, but also doubled the ambiguity just
about everywhere, so I think it's probably not quite right!

Backed out the change to check that that really happened (since
the 32 examples with increased ambiguity can't all involve
verb-slot6) and sure enough, it did.  I think there might be something
buggy here in the slot code, but maybe the problem was that
verb-slot6 was optional twice (with the opt check box and because
the other things could hop over it and get to 1,2,3,4).  That
combined with saying 1,2,3,4 instead of just 1,4 like verb-slot
5 might have done it.  Trying this now:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot2
    verb-slot6_input3_type=verb-slot3
    verb-slot6_input4_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_name=aspect
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_value=habitual

That gained one (#15) but lost two (#24, #35).

Next try:

  verb-slot6_name=aspect-marker
  verb-slot6_opt=on
  verb-slot6_order=after
    verb-slot6_input1_type=verb-slot1
    verb-slot6_input2_type=verb-slot4
    verb-slot6_morph1_name=habitual-aspect-marker
    verb-slot6_morph1_orth=-la
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_name=aspect
    verb-slot6_morph1_feat1_value=habitual

That worked (once I fixed a typo from input4 to input2).

I'm looking at the right lex rule, though, so passing this
one over to Safiyyah.

8/10/2009-SS Disclosure: Unlike with changes to other grammars, I did not keep detailed notes as I was making changes. There were a lot of false starts--changes that didn't work out--and I did not keep track of these systematically.  In order to get some of the details I had to go back and diff the changes I made to choices-abkh with the version of the file I started with. I diffed by final version with the original.  This means that while the changes noted here are accurate, it is possible that the sequence and motivation behind them is not.

 
I started with the three sentences that were well-formed but were errors in tsdb indicating that a lexical anlysis could not be found for them.

Exs 68, 69, 70.  I also fixed the numbering in the abkhaz.txt file so that it matched tsdb.

All three of these failed because j-jə-ba-jt was not being analyzed.  
I added (after a few false starts getting the gender values not quite right) the following to the choices-abk.

 verb-slot2_morph9_name=3pl-no-vowel-erg-obj-marker

      verb-slot2_morph10_feat2_head=obj

Coverage 94.3% 33/35
Overgeneration 1.9% 1/54

All three parsed.  I think this introduced ambiguity in lexical rules.  (The ambiguity may have been introduced by a change that I did not keep track of) The ergative verb was being allowed to go through non-ergative subject and object marker rules.  I split apart the rule where the ergative and non-ergative verbs were both serving as input

verb-slot13_name=erg-aorist-negative
  verb-slot13_order=before
    verb-slot13_input1_type=verb2
    verb-slot13_morph1_name=erg-aorist-negative-marker

      verb-slot13_morph1_feat2_value=aorist
      verb-slot13_morph1_feat2_head=verb

Trying to fix the ambiguity, showed up errors in the way some of the lex rules were ordered.  I kept making small changes that I didn't keep track of.  

At one point Ex 15 was not parsing

Ex 84 would not parse because the stative verb was not serving as input to the
subj-marker-lex rule for statives.  I added
verb-slot11_input2_type=verb1

Ex 88 showed up as an overgeneration error, but looking at the example it should have been coded as grammatical (and was originally intended to demonstrate grammaticality). I change abkhaz.txt and created a new item file, but for some reason the new file did not change the grammaticality judgement.  I finally decided to go into the item file and manually change 88 from 0 to 1.   


This is as far as my recollection of the sequence of changes goes.  At some point I also made the following changes to choices-abkhaz

I changed noun7's gender constraint to non-human and masculine (The customization system prints this out as non-feminine).  Previously it was masculine only
noun7_name=2sing-masc
noun7_name=2sing-masc-non-human


noun7_feat2_value=masculine
noun7_feat2_value=masculine, non-human

I changed one of the inputs for verb_slot1 to verb_slot13 instead of verb_slot9 because verb_slot9 had been split into two and the part that went into 13 should be the input for 1.

I constrainted verb-slot1_morph4, verb-slot2_morph4, verb-slot3_morph4 and verb-slot4_morph4 and verbslot11_morph4 to be 2singlar instead of just singular.  This was probably motivated by overgeneration

I changed the names of some of the lexical rules to be more transparent

I changed one of the input values of verb_slot5 to verb_slot2 instead of verb_slot1 so that the obj-subj prefix markers would be attached to verb before the tense markers.

I added that for verb_slot6_feat1_head=verb.  It had been unspecified and showed and red asterisk on the lexicon page of the website.

There is still some ambiguity, but for two of the examples, I don't think that there is a way to resolve it given the current system

I think that when the nouns come from the same class, word order is used to determine the semantics.  The subject precedes the object.

8/18/2009-SS Safiyyah's response to Antske's questions

Abkhaz: #41 and #42: their MRSs are identical, the glosses say something about exclusive/inclusive, but I am not sure what this would mean for 2nd person, what is the difference between the two?

According to one of the references grammars some grammarians think that the difference between the two first person and two second person plural pronouns is inclusive-exclusive, but others reject this view.  The author does not come down on either side, but also doesn't offer what the other grammarians consider the difference to be.  Are they just two variant forms with no semantic difference?  The author doesn't really say.  Since inclusive-exclusive was given as a possible difference, I included it.  It really doesn't come to play in grammar though because there is no inclusive-exclusive distinction in argument markers.

#54: what are the glosses of the verb supposed to be?
the verb is "ba" and it is supposed to be glossed as see.  That is the way that it is in the test suite.  Perhaps, I am not understanding the question.

#58: should "də-r-ba-jt" be "də-rə-ba-jt"?
Yes it should.  I changed the test suite.

#71: should "d-j?-ba-jt" be "də-jə-ba-jt"?
Yes it should. I changed the test suite.

#72: should "a-təpha-t͡ɕʷʰa" be "a-təpha-t͡ʂʰa"?
Actually, I think that 72 is correct and #69 and the grammar had the wrong spelling for the human-plural morpheme.  I changed the test suite.

#80 + #81: should "j?-j?-ba-jt" be "jə-jə-ba-jt"?
Yes.  I changed the test suite.

I cleaned up the extraneous question marks.  This was left over from when I had unicode characters and did not save the file with correct encoding.
