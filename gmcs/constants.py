'''
Choices v. 29

Try to use these constants instead of literal strings, when possible.
This helps prevent typo bugs, which can sometimes be tricky to debug in python,
and makes the code much easier to maintain (suppose a convention for a particular
choice changes; you will only need to correct it once here rather than throughout
the code).

Append with new constants, if they are likely to be used across modules.
